- Fixed a bug to support the case where a job is enqueued, deleted, then reenqueued via a new reference to the existing job instance.
- Removed `Marj.execute` in favor of just using `job.perform_now`.
- Introduced `Marj::Record` to replace the `ActiveRecord` functionality in `Marj`.
- Introduced `Marj::Jobs` and `Marj::Relation` to provide an interface to enqueued jobs rather than records.
- Removed `Marj.table_name`. To override the table name, set `Marj::Record.table_name` or create a custom `ActiveRecord` model class.
- Added support for using Marj to write to multiple databases.
- Added support for creating custom jobs interfaces, for instance `MyJob.ready.first`.
