- Fixed a bug to support the case where a job is enqueued, deleted, then reenqueued via a new reference to the existing job instance.
- Removed `Marj.execute` in favor of just using `job.perform_now`.
- Updated `Marj` to not extend `ActiveRecord::Base`. Replaced by `MarjRecord`.
- Updated `Marj` to provide an interface to enqueued jobs rather than records.
- Remove `Marj.table_name`. To override the table name, set `MarjRecord.table_name`.
